### Test Transfer Flow with Account Numbers

### Step 1: Get accounts to find account numbers
GET http://localhost:8080/api/accounts
Accept: application/json

### Step 2: Check if account exists by account number (replace ACC1234567890 with actual account number)
GET http://localhost:8080/api/accounts/number/ACC1234567890/exists
Accept: application/json

### Step 3: Get account details by account number
GET http://localhost:8080/api/accounts/number/ACC1234567890
Accept: application/json

### Step 4: Process a transfer using account IDs (from frontend perspective)
# The frontend still uses account IDs for the actual transfer
# It just looks up the account ID using the account number first
POST http://localhost:8080/api/transactions
Content-Type: application/json
