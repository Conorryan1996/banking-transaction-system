# Transfer Flow Update: Using Account Numbers

## Overview
The transfer functionality has been updated to use account numbers instead of customer IDs for better user experience and security.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

1. **Account Service**
   - Added endpoint: `GET /accounts/number/{accountNumber}` - Get account details by account number
   - Added endpoint: `GET /accounts/number/{accountNumber}/exists` - Check if account exists
   - Added methods in AccountService to support account number lookups

### Frontend Changes

1. **TransferDialog Component**
   - Changed from asking for customer ID to account number
   - Updated validation flow to check account existence and status
   - Improved error messages for better user feedback

## How It Works

1. User enters recipient's account number (e.g., ACC1000001)
2. Frontend validates the account exists and is active
3. Frontend retrieves account details and customer information
4. Transfer is processed using the account IDs (unchanged backend flow)

## Example Account Numbers (from test data)
- ACC1000001 - Active checking account
- ACC1000002 - Active savings account
- ACC1000003 - Active business checking account
- ACC1000004 - Active business savings account
- ACC1000005 - Active checking account
- ACC1000006 - Frozen savings account (cannot receive transfers)

## Testing

1. Start the system with docker-compose
2. Access the frontend at http://localhost:3000
3. Login and navigate to an account
4. Click "Transfer" and enter a recipient account number
5. Complete the transfer flow

## API Examples

```bash
# Check if account exists
curl http://localhost:8080/api/accounts/number/ACC1000001/exists

# Get account details
curl http://localhost:8080/api/accounts/number/ACC1000001
```
