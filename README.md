# Banking Transaction System

A microservices-based banking transaction system built with Spring Boot, gRPC, Kafka, and React.

## System Architecture

The system consists of the following microservices:
- **Account Service** (Port 5000/9000): Manages bank accounts and balances
- **Customer Service** (Port 5001/9001): Handles customer registration and management
- **Transaction Service** (Port 5002/9002): Processes deposits, withdrawals, and transfers
- **Fraud Service** (Port 5003/9003): Real-time fraud detection and monitoring
- **Auth Service** (Port 5004/9004): JWT-based authentication and authorization
- **API Gateway** (Port 8080): Spring Cloud Gateway for routing
- **Frontend** (Port 3000): React-based web application

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Spring Boot 3.4.5, Java 17
- **Frontend**: React 18, Material-UI
- **Communication**: gRPC for inter-service, REST for external APIs
- **Message Queue**: Apache Kafka for event streaming
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15 (separate DB per service)
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with Spring Security
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Java 17
- Maven 3.9+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+ (for local frontend development)

### Build and Run

```bash
# Option 1: Use the build script (recommended)
./build.sh
docker-compose up

# Option 2: Manual build
# If package-lock.json is missing for frontend:
(cd banking-frontend && npm install)

# Build all Java services
mvn clean install

# Start the entire system
docker-compose up --build

# Access the application
# Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# API Gateway: http://localhost:8080
```

**Note**: The frontend requires a `package-lock.json` file. The build script automatically generates it if missing, or you can run `npm install` in the `banking-frontend` directory.

## Using the System

1. **Create an Account**:
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000
   - Click "Register" and fill in your details
   - Check server logs for temporary credentials

2. **Login**:
   - Use the generated username and password
   - JWT tokens are automatically managed

3. **Banking Operations**:
   - View account balance
   - Make deposits
   - Make withdrawals (with fraud detection)
   - View transaction history

## Fraud Detection

The system includes real-time fraud detection with the following rules:
- Daily withdrawal limit: $1,000
- Maximum 5 withdrawals per day
- Transactions exceeding limits are blocked

## Development

= Previous Conversation Compacted =====================================================================================

> This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
<analysis>
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation:

1. **Initial Request**: User asked me to scan the banking transaction system repository to understand what's happening. I created a comprehensive analysis of the microservices architecture, identifying
   6 core services (Account, Customer, Transaction, Fraud, Auth, API Gateway), their technologies (Spring Boot, gRPC, Kafka, PostgreSQL, Docker), and communication patterns.

2. **Build and Run Request**: User asked me to build the code via `./build.sh` and bring up containers, fixing any problems. This was the main focus of our interaction.

3. **Build Script Fix**: I found and fixed a syntax error in build.sh (extra `]` on line 23).

4. **Auth Service Issues**:
   - Auth service was failing due to incorrect database URL (pointing to localhost instead of container name)
   - Fixed application.properties to use `postgres-auth:5432` instead of `localhost:5436`
   - Auth service then failed due to missing gRPC authentication configuration
   - Created GrpcSecurityConfig.java to provide required bean
   - Auth service container had docker-compose issues, so I started it manually with docker run

5. **Registration Failure Investigation**: User reported that frontend registration was failing. I traced the issue:
   - Frontend made POST request to /api/customers
   - API Gateway routed to customer-service
   - Customer-service returned 500 error due to gRPC version incompatibility
   - Error: `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: 'void io.grpc.ClientStreamTracer.createPendingStream()'`

6. **gRPC Version Fix**:
   - Customer-service had mismatched gRPC versions between dependencies
   - Modified customer-service pom.xml to use compatible versions
   - Changed from complex exclusions to simple grpc-client-spring-boot-starter:2.14.0.RELEASE
   - Added grpc-server-spring-boot-starter:2.14.0.RELEASE
   - Successfully rebuilt and restarted customer-service

The conversation shows a systematic debugging process, starting from build issues, through container startup problems, to runtime errors, with each problem being identified through logs and fixed
appropriately.
</analysis>

  <summary>
  1. Primary Request and Intent:
     - Initially: Scan the banking transaction system repository to understand the architecture and how it works
     - Main request: Build the code using `./build.sh` command, bring up the containers, and fix any problems encountered
     - Specific issue: Investigate why account registration failed in the frontend with "registration failed" error

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Microservices architecture with Spring Boot 3.4.5 and Java 17
   - Inter-service communication via gRPC (version 1.53.0)
   - Event-driven architecture using Apache Kafka
   - PostgreSQL databases (one per service)
   - Docker containerization with docker-compose
   - API Gateway pattern using Spring Cloud Gateway
   - JWT authentication
   - Saga pattern for distributed transactions

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/banking-transaction-system/build.sh`
      - Fixed syntax error removing extra `]` on line 23
      - Essential for building all services with docker-compose
      ```bash
      echo "✅ package-lock.json generated"
      fi
      
      # Build all services
      ```

   - `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/banking-transaction-system/auth-service/src/main/resources/application.properties`
      - Changed database URL from localhost to container name for Docker networking
      ```properties
      spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://postgres-auth:5432/auth_db
      ```

   - `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/banking-transaction-system/auth-service/src/main/java/com/pm/authservice/config/GrpcSecurityConfig.java`
      - Created new file to provide required gRPC authentication bean
      ```java
      package com.pm.authservice.config;

      import net.devh.boot.grpc.server.security.authentication.GrpcAuthenticationReader;
      import net.devh.boot.grpc.server.security.authentication.BearerAuthenticationReader;
      import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
      import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

      @Configuration
      public class GrpcSecurityConfig {

          @Bean
          public GrpcAuthenticationReader grpcAuthenticationReader() {
              return new BearerAuthenticationReader(token -> null);
          }
      }
      ```

   - `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/banking-transaction-system/customer-service/pom.xml`
      - Fixed gRPC version incompatibility by simplifying dependencies
      - Changed from complex exclusions to compatible starter versions
      ```xml
      <!-- gRPC Spring Boot Starter - use version compatible with gRPC 1.53.0 -->
      <dependency>
          <groupId>net.devh</groupId>
          <artifactId>grpc-client-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
          <version>2.14.0.RELEASE</version>
      </dependency>
      <dependency>
          <groupId>net.devh</groupId>
          <artifactId>grpc-server-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
          <version>2.14.0.RELEASE</version>
      </dependency>
      ```

4. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Build script syntax error (extra `]`)
   - **Solved**: Auth service database connection (localhost → container name)
   - **Solved**: Auth service missing GrpcAuthenticationReader bean
   - **Solved**: Docker-compose container recreation issues (used docker run directly)
   - **Solved**: Customer service gRPC version incompatibility causing registration failure
   - **Ongoing**: Monitoring if customer service starts successfully after rebuild

5. Pending Tasks:
   - Verify customer-service is running properly after the gRPC fix
   - Test the registration flow again to confirm it works
   - Check if other services (transaction-service, fraud-service) need similar gRPC version fixes

6. Current Work:
   Started the rebuilt customer-service container with fixed gRPC dependencies. The container ID is `2f7254203b78b3717377bfac7ba6836e50e38c97660338643b9127b78436e9b1`. This was done to resolve the
   registration failure that occurred when the customer-service threw a `NoSuchMethodError` due to incompatible gRPC versions.

7. Optional Next Step:
   Check if the customer-service is running properly and test the registration flow again to verify the fix worked. From the most recent work: "docker run -d --name customer-service --network
   banking-transaction-system_banking-network -p 5001:5001 -p 9001:9001 banking-transaction-system_customer-service" - I should verify this container is healthy and then test if registration now works
   through the frontend.
